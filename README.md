## Research artifact outside IISG

To gain more knowledge about the collection of stamps and the meaning of them separately I also did research outside of the IISG.  

### Collection of stamps:

For people in Iran, postage stamps are a reminder of the control the government has over their identity, their culture and the interpretation of their history.

The current postage stamps used in Iran symbolise the country after its 1979 Islamic revolution. After it overthrew the Persian monarchy, Iran became an authoritarian country with an uncompromising version of Islam at its core.

But there is more to the country than its post-revolution history. Jamshidi explains, “For Iranians who left their homes during the 1979 Islamic revolution and couldn’t go back, the stamps on the letters they received from their families in Iran became a window to the life in Iran.

“I became interested in the narratives and history that exist between the stories shown on the stamps.”

The stamps have featured people such as Kavous Seyed-Emami, an Iranian-Canadian professor and environmentalist, who was detained by Iranian intelligence agents, and who then died in prison at the age of 64.

### Stamp in general

A postage stamp is a small piece of paper issued by a post office, postal administration, or other authorized vendors to customers who pay postage, who then affix the stamp to the face or address-side of any item of mail—an envelope or other postal cover —that they wish to send.

[Cinderella stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_stamp)

**Cinderella stamp**

In philately, a cinderella stamp is "virtually anything resembling a postage stamp, but not issued for postal purposes by a government postal administration". The term excludes imprinted stamps on postal stationery.

**Political and propaganda stamps**

While it is common to find patriotic sentiments on official stamps, the term propaganda stamp is usually used to mean unofficial stamps produced to promote a particular ideology, or to create confusion within an enemy state. Stamps with encouraging slogans have been attached to letters for prisoners of war, or troops serving abroad.

How are stamps made?

## The stamp as a political messenger

**Stamps as Messengers of Political Transition (USSR/Russia Transition Years)**

In 2005 Pauliina Raento and I wrote, "It is the visual qualities which make a stamp an important messenger that implements the state's official outlook in the everyday life of ordinary citizens" (p. 143). We couched our argument, using Finland as an example, by noting that when states emphasize "the visual," which includes maps, postage stamps, currency, and official Web sites, they inform and educate their own populations and those beyond about where they are, who they are, and what they are about. A policy of "political visualization" may also invigorate nationalism in times of political transition. In this study I investigate what stamps tell us about the Soviet/Russian transition years.

Previous studies of postage stamps noted their importance in promoting national identity and the objectives of the state. Neglected in this literature by geographers and others is a discussion of stamp themes and issues during political and economic transitions. A content analysis of issues during the Soviet Union's last three years and Russia's first three years revealed some significant changes. The Soviet Union issued many stamps and sets on a wide variety of topics, including nature, folk items and legends, international ties, and ideology. Russia issued fewer stamps: Nature was important, but religion and issues that promoted Russia's heritage replaced ideology and international themes. Early Russian stamps evoked an “inward” worldview that promoted a nascent nationalism. In its final years the Soviet Union noted evidence of these changes in priorities and themes with issues that depicted Soviet environmental disasters or honored the individuals killed in the failed Russian coup attempt in August 1991.

**Postzegels zijn ware identiteitsdragers en dus voer voor cultuurgeografen. Neem Nederlandse en Duitse postzegels over de afgelopen 150 jaar: ze vertellen opvallend verschillende verhalen over de beleefde nationale identiteit. En over de ontwikkeling daarin.**

Als je studie maakt van het uitgiftebeleid van nationale postdiensten, geven postzegels een veelzeggend inzicht in de wijze waarop nationale identiteiten worden gemanifesteerd. Ze laten bovendien zien hoe dat in de loop van de tijd verandert. Postzegels visualiseren zelfbeelden van nationale identiteit en doen dat op een manier die â€“ vaak onbewust â€“ grote invloed heeft op het (ver)vormen van collectieve beelden en herinneringen. Postzegels zijn commucatieminiaturen bij uitstek, voor afzender Ã©n geadresseerde. Het visuele geheugen wordt erdoor getraind en op die manier zetten zich ook collectieve herinneringen vast, aldus Grever en ook Raento & Brunn. Postzegels zijn typische massaconsumptiegoederen. Iedereen krijgt ze onder ogen en het totale aantal zegels dat in omloop is gebracht, loopt in Nederland en Duitsland in de vele miljarden. Van de eerste postzegel van Nederland (1852), met het hoofd van koning Willem III erop, werden er al bijna 20 miljoen in omloop gebracht (zegel 1). Bij recente Nederlandse standaardzegels gaat het om oplagen boven de 100 miljoen en bij speciale zegels om oplagen vanaf een half miljoen. Van Duitse bijzondere uitgiften worden de laatste jaren enkele tientallen miljoenen exemplaren gemaakt.

Postal Propaganda of the Third Reich:

"For it is certain that the images and messages seen by Germans on their stamps, postcards and postmarks did have an incredible impact upon shaping public perceptions. Their sheer volume alone undoubtedly made them as important as almost any other medium (Moore, 2003, p. 136)."

## The Future of the stamp

**A Bold Vision for the Future of the Postage Stamp:**

Madden's team created Signet, a system that could radically overhaul how we use the US Postal Service. At its core, it is a digital stamp and an app. If you want to send a parcel, you'd simply stamp it with a device that uses a laser to etch it with your name and a unique identifying pattern. After that, the USPS would pick up your package; from there, the app would prompt you to provide the name of the person you're trying to reach. Don't know their address? No problem: You could provide it in the app, or the service would ping the recipient on their phone, requesting info about to send the package—or defaulting to any address they might already have listed in the app. Once the addressee is entered and the package arrives at a sorting center, it's re-stamped with the addressee's name and another unique identifying pattern.

Stamps of the future/relevance:

[Opinion: Will postage stamps ever lose their relevance to the design world?](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/stamps)

"Stamps are as much the markers of the age in which they are designed as, say, money is, and as such, they often bear the echo of trends which characterise that era."

## Preservation of the artifact

### Concepts

- Creating a mini online, interactive archive from the collection of stamps. By giving each stamp multiple tags, you can search in a more specific way. You can search by year, topic, country etc. When you click on a stamp you find additional information. For example a video, pictures, an interview or a translation of the stamp (transcoding). In the end this will be the platform where all my transcodings will come together.
- Translating: making text only stamps in English, most of them are in Farsi now.
- Creating an image analyzer from processing. What colours are used the most, what does this say? can I find certain patterns?
- Creating some sort of tutorial/instruction sheet on how a stamp is used.

### Experiments of transcoding

First I make good pictures of the stamps separately at the archive. After that I ordered them by year:

![Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/time1.png](Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/time1.png)

![Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/time2.png](Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/time2.png)

![Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/time3.png](Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/time3.png)

I recreated a stamp sheet by multiplying one scan of a stamp, and by using the sewing machine to imitate the holes for ripping a stamp off the sheet.

![Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/sheet.png](Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/sheet.png)

I translated all the stamps with the use of google translate and my Iranian friend Ali:

![Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/IMG_1973.png](Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/IMG_1973.png)

![Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/IMG_2218.png](Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/IMG_2218.png)

After that I made a list of different tags/filters for the online archive I want to make. In excel I made a list, combining all the tags with the different stamps: 

![Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/Schermafbeelding_2020-03-25_om_09.44.25.png](Collection%20114%20stamps%20of%20the%20eight%20years%20war%20of%20Ir/Schermafbeelding_2020-03-25_om_09.44.25.png)

When this was done I wrote it in code language:

{
image: "pad/naar/afbeelding",
tags: [Violence, War, Religion, Propaganda, Gun, Flag, Water],
year: 1981
}

And I made sketches of how I want my website to work/look:

## Transcoding

1. Digital archive website: 
2. **Text only stamps (English):** Here I removed all the images and left only text. All of the text in Farsi I translated to English.

1. **Tool to create new images from elements of stamps:** I want to create a sort of drawing tool with which you can create new images/posters. I take shapes/elements out of the collection of stamps I have from the archive. As a user you can drag the shapes, change colours/size and make new compositions.

Example: paint

Quick sketch:

4. Collecting album

Collecting stamps is becoming a bit old school. What are modern ways of collecting?

5. Making stamp more neutral/subjective or more peacefull.

What happens if I remove all the guns from an image. How does this change the image?

If I make a lot of these they can become a book or be somehow integrated in my website.

6. Bandana/Tulip,Fist icon

While I was making filters for the visual aspect they come back a lot in the stamps, I noticed that the Bandana and the Tulip,Fist icon appear a lot. So these are two thing I also might want to do something with but I am not sure yet what this could be…

**Heartbeat Iran:** Every spread not only aims at presenting this duality, contrast or similarity, but also relates to corresponding images elsewhere in the book (as depicted on page 72 and 73). Crosslinks based on descriptive keywords (tags) allow for contextual searching and browsing. In this sense, Heartbeat Iran should be seen as a publication that reconsiders the linear form of a book and makes a first step towards a dynamic network structure comparable to Youtube. With this book the artists pay tribute to the traditional Persian hospitality and even try to counteract efforts to demonize Iran in the media.
